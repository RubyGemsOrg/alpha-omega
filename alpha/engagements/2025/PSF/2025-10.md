### NSF withdrawal post published to PSF blog

Python Software Foundation published that we've
[withdrawn from the NSF Safe-OSE](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/NSF-funding-statement.html).
There was lots of writing, reviewing, and approvals from this.
From this post there has been an outpouring of support from our community.

### White Paper: Slippery ZIPs and Sticky tar-pits: Security & Archives

Published a white paper to [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper-by-seth-larson-python-software-foundation/)
and the [PSF blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2025/10/slippery-zips-and-sticky-tar-pits-security-and-archives-white-paper.html) about software repository
archives, differential attacks, and ecosystem integrity. The work completed
and suggested can be replicated in other software ecosystems or worked
on as a group to develop similar standards about what archive features should
be accepted for both ZIP and tar.

This work was shared within the OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories WG
and is currently being discussed whether a tool, standard, or testdata can
be created amongst the group so the recommendations in this white paper
and from other groups can be used by everyone.

### PEP 811: Python Security Response Team

Seth [authored PEP 811](https://peps.python.org/pep-0811/), led the [pre-PEP discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/104199), and has published the
draft that's [being reviewed actively](https://discuss.python.org/t/104606). The PEP defines the membership policy,
how the PSRT operates, by using per-project GitHub Security Advisories.

The PEP's goal is to encourage more contributors from the large pool of Python community members
and core team members that may be interested in security to have a clear path
towards getting started with contributing.

Alongside this project, kicked off the PSRT GHSA bot/automation
work with Jacob Coffee, an Infrastructure Engineer at the PSF.

## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

### GitLab Trusted Publishing - Self-Managed Instance Support

Mike made significant progress on enabling Trusted Publishing for self-managed GitLab instances,
a highly requested feature particularly from enterprise users.
This work involved substantial architectural changes to support dynamic issuer URLs
rather than the previously hardcoded `https://gitlab.com`.

Key implementation work included:

- Added [`issuer_url` column to GitLabPublisher model](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18814) for storing custom issuer URLs
- Implemented [issuer lookup functionality](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18892) to validate and retrieve GitLab instances
- Fixed [case-sensitivity issues in GitLab publishers](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18805)
- [Refactored OIDC views](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18811) to improve maintainability
- Added [user interface for selecting GitLab issuers](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18916)
- Updated [JWKS storage to use issuer as cache key](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18862)
- Added [metrics tags to include issuer_url](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18864)

Mike tested the implementation end-to-end with salsa.debian.org (though it is too old at version 18.0.6),
and began coordinated with beta testers from the community.
He also created tooling to verify GitLab instance compatibility and JWT claims.

### Malware Response

Mike processed over 100 reports in October.
The automated quarantine system continued to operate with zero false positives.

### Security Incident Response

Mike responded to a critical phishing campaign targeting PyPI users on September 23rd
(extending into early October). The attack used the domain `pypi-mirror.org`
as a reverse proxy to capture credentials. Mike:

- Coordinated immediate response and user notifications
- Identified and froze compromised accounts
- Reset passwords for affected users
- Reported the domain to Google Safe Browsing and Cloudflare Abuse
- Collaborated with Seth Larson on the [public blog post](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-09-23-plenty-of-phish-in-the-sea/)

### ZIP Archive Security Improvements

Mike collaborated with Seth Larson and William Woodruff to address ZIP differential attacks.
The team [implemented restrictions on ZIP archive processing](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18846)
to prevent exploitation of implementation differences between ZIP parsers.
This included adding testing tools and documentation about the vulnerability.

### Planning and Documentation

- Developed project proposals for 2-month focused initiatives in response to funding changes
- Documented testing procedures for GitLab JWT token validation
- Proposed implementing Trusted Account Links as a future security enhancement

### Infrastructure Improvements

- Upgraded PyPI to [Python 3.13.8](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18821)
- Fixed [missing issuer_url issues](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/18879)
- Implemented [custom metrics checker for tags](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18927)
- Fixed [event tags and submitted values](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18897)
- Added [type hints for OIDC modules](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18798)
- [Refactored organization application tests](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18832)

### Community Engagement

Mike participated in multiple community activities:

- Participated in **Alpha-Omega Public Meeting** on October 1st, discussing Trusted Publishing expansion
  and engaging with the Erlang ecosystem representative about self-hosted instance validation
- Attended **OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories Working Group** monthly meeting on October 15th,
  sharing PyPI's self-audit progress and discussing malware reporting improvements
- Presented at the **PSF Board Meeting** on October 22nd with updates on security initiatives
- Engaged with potential beta testers for GitLab Self-Managed Trusted Publishing
- Attended **GitHub Universe** + Community Day
